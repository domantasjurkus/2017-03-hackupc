## Crowd-E

The goal of this project is to create an application that leverages GPS to provide support for people in emergency situations. The general idea is to gamify the experience: each user is a Supporter who is capable of assisting Victims in a number of ways, most of which would be pre-defined by the user's profile. At any time any user is able to call for assistance and therefore mark themselves as a Victim. In case of emergency both the Victim and Supporters are able to call appropriate services based on the severity of the situation. If the Supporter is able to aid the Victim, they can both mark the situation as resolved without involving any public services.
