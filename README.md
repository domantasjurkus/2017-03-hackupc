## Crowd-E

In this connected world that we live in, technology needs to be put into good use. As recent developments in collaborative economy have shown us, having a network of central nodes can enhance collaboration even when some people decline to help. This is why we are building Crowd-E; a platform in which you can help people nearby until the emergency services arrives because... Would you want help someday?
